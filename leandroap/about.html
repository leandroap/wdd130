                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Have you ever had an idea that would make life easier? Surely yes, but how many times have you not known how to start from scratch, and get that idea off paper?</p>
                <p>My name is Leandro Pereira, and I made this site to share my experience, and help people know me.</p>
                <p>As a Technical Lead, I help people understand how to use technology to solve daily problems. In my company, I'm also recognized as a natural leader because of my team building skills.</p>

            <h3>Professional</h3>
            <p>I began working with IT in 2002 as a help desk analyst, I used to give support for software programs and microcomputers. In this job, I also had experience assisting in the development of department intranet improvements.</p>
            <P>Since 2007 I have been working with software development using a lot of different programming languages, frameworks, and software engineering methodologies.</P>
            <P>Now I'm a software engineer with over 10 years experience, and I work as a Technical Lead in a software engineering team leading a squad of mobile apps.</P>
            <P>I have large experience working as a Tech Lead and I have been doing it in large projects, such as technological evolution, systems merges, regulatory demands and launching new products and businesses.</P>

            <h3>Academic</h3>
            <p>I was introduced to the computing world in high school, when I studied in a technical school named "Instituto Paralelo de Ensino" where I took my occupational education in IT.</p>
            <p>I'm Bachelor of Information Systems of Universidade Anhembi Morumbi, and I have MBA in Developing Applications and Games for mobile devices from FIAP - Faculdade de Informática e Administração Paulista.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I like the model of teaching one another. I enjoy learning in places like Meetups or developers groups.</p>
            <p>Recently, I obtained a certificate from BYU-Pathway Worldwide in the PathwayConnect program. I was reflecting about all my academic life, and I don't remember the last time I learned as much as I did that time. This just was possible because I dedicated myself to studies in those semesters like I had never done before.</p>

                <h3>Personal Life</h3>
                <p>After high school, and before starting at university, I dedicated two years of my life as a volunteer serving as a missionary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. During this time, I served and lived in some cities in the south of Bahia, Brazil.</p>
                <p>When I came back home, I met an amazing woman who became my best friend, and I married her. With her, I have four beautiful daughters.</p>
