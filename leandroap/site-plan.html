        Content
      </h2>
      <p>
        I'm planning to build a personal site to share my experience, and help people know me.
        <br>As additional pages, I'm thinking of an "about me" page, and a second one similar to a blog where I would share ideas, tips, and experiences.
      </p>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        To my home page I want to have a clean layout with a blue background, a big picture, my full name, a short sentence about me like <i>"Husband of an amazing woman, Father of some princesses, Developer and tech lover."</i>, and my social media links.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img class="home-bg" src="images/home_bg1.jpg" alt="image for homepage">
        <img class="home-bg" src="images/home_bg2.jpg" alt="image for homepage">

      </ul>
      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        In the "about me" page, I will have a picture of me, and maybe another of my family. Here I will write who I am, my academic background and credentials, and a little of my professional skills and experiences.
      </p>

      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        I will start with my elevator pitch as an introduction:<br><br>
        <i>"Have you ever had an idea that would make life easier? Surely yes, but how many times have you not known how to start from scratch, and get that idea off paper?<br>
        As a Technical Lead, I help people understand how to use technology to solve daily problems.<br>
        My name is Leandro Pereira, I work as a Technical Lead in a software engineering team, and I'm a software engineer with over 10 years experience. <br>
        I have large experience working as a Tech Lead and I have been doing it in large projects, such as technological evolution, systems merges, regulatory demands and launching new products and businesses.<br>
        In my company, I'm also recognized as a natural leader because of my team building skills."</i>
      </p>

      <h4>Professional</h4>
      <p>
        This introduction will be followed by my professional section, with my professional experiences. It will have the companies where I had worked, with a short description of some projects I worked on, or some achievement. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Led our team through the creation of a new loans platform, including the offer of three different products within our digital channels in 7 months.</li>
        <li>Provided a solution for 11,000+ customers to have access to the "PEAC Maquininhas" offer as subsidized by BNDES, which led to becoming the acquirer who granted most loans under this program.</li>
        <li>Implemented a Car Inspection System that allowed new customers to conduct inspections by themselves. The app has a store rating of 4.8 stars - the highest evaluation of the company.</li>
        <li>Conducted the migration of the Bonus Confirmation's Center systems, participating as IT representative in monthly meetings with other insurers. This migration reduced the waiting time for confirmation from days to a few seconds.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Academic</h4>
      <p>
        After the professional section, I will have another one including my academic background. In this point I will mention my MBA, my bachelor degree, and some certificates or courses. Maybe something like:<br><br>
        I have a Bachelor of Information Systems by Universidade Anhembi Morumbi, and an MBA in Developing Applications and Games for mobile devices by FIAP - Faculdade de Informática e Administração Paulista.<br>
        Probably I will write something about the BYU Pathway Connect, I just don't know yet how I will write it. 
      </p>

      <h4>Personal Life </h4>
      <p>
        Then for a final section I will tell a little about my personal life, and my volunteering service as a missionary. I don’t want to write too many details about my personal life here, but in general I will share that I’m married, how many kids I have, and when and where I served as a missionary.

      </ul>
      <h3>"Blog"</h3>
      <p>
        On the other hand, in the page that for now I’m calling “blog”, I just have a brief idea about how it will be. But I'm thinking about publishing some essays I did in the past, how I solved some technical issue, how to articles, my opinion and analysis of some topics.
