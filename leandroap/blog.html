                </aside>
                <p>Some years ago a friend asked me if I could be a superhero and have any superpower, what would be my choice. I promptly answered “The Batman”. He was surprised and did not like it, then he said that Batman was only an ordinary guy without any special superpower and firmly I said that was one of my favorite characteristics of Batman.</p>
                <p>Everybody who knows me could say what my favorite superhero character is. With no doubt, for me Batman is the best superhero character because he is an ordinary guy without super powers, who uses his wealth, cleverness and cool gadgets to fight against crime.</p>
                <p>The interesting thing about Batman is he could be one of us because like him we have no special or magical power. He did not suffer any transformation in his body or strength. Similar to him we can be involved in causes to make the world a better place doing what is good and right.</p>
                <p>Bruce Wayne's life changed with the early separation from his parents. Bruce received a heritage and joining the wealth to his pain made Batman possible. Before this abrupt change, he was raised with good principles and instructions.</p>
                <p>In the premortal life we learn the Heavenly Father's plan, and He instructed us. To be able to receive our divine heritage we choose to come here; which implies a separation too.</p>
                <p>We face daily battles with the enemy of our Heavenly Father. It is not always easy, and we fall sometimes, but we learn how to raise again. Becoming stronger each day avoiding temptations the enemy influence has less power over our lives.</p>
                <p>Like us, Batman has his own enemies and big battles. He usually wins, but sometimes the losses and consequences are inevitable. With persistence, he continues following in the path fighting against the crime.</p>
                <p>Allying Bruce's wealth with his cleverness, Batman has an infinity of cool gadgets; which makes his life easier. For example in the Batman's utility belt there is the batarang, bat-darts, gas pellets, etc.</p>
                <p>We can not forget the batmobile, rocket boots, kryptonite ring, bat-nets, glider wings, ear microphones, among other things. If we think a little that things are not so far from our reality.</p>
                <p>This reality becomes even closer if we compare all these gadgets with the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Like Batman, we have an infinity of cool gifts that we can choose to use along our way.</p>
                <p>There are a lot of superheroes characters and each one can choose your favorite. My friend was surprised and did not accept my opinion because for him Superman is the best superhero. He thinks that with all Superman's special superpowers he could overcome Batman.</p>
                <p>In fact Superman has great and incredible powers and a supernatural strength. Some of these powers give some advantage to him, but he has weaknesses too. Besides that, all these powers are so far from our reality.</p>
                <p>After a while of debating I said my second option of favorite superhero “The Spider-Man”. Again my friend can not believe in my choice. For him Spider-Man is another ordinary guy, and here lies my point of view too.</p>
                <p>Spider-Man is another simple boy who after receiving a spider bite has some senses increased. He has the Spider Sense that helps him feel some warnings in dangerous situations. This give some advantage, putting him some steps forward.</p>
                <p>Like him when we get baptized, we receive the Gift of Holy Ghost that becomes our personal warning voice in dangerous situations.</p>
                <p>His life has some similarities with Batman's life. He suffered some early losses, and was raised with good principles and instructions. Spider-Man also uses his cleverness to build some cool gadgets like his spider-net.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, Batman and Spider-Man are two ordinary guys that could be one of us and that is the bright thing.</p>
