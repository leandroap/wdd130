    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Leandro Amaral Pereira</h2>
    <img src="images/IMG_5323.JPG" style="width:50%;">
    <p>Hello, I'm from Brazil, I was born and live in a city named São Paulo. I'm a senior system analyst in the bank Itaú Unibanco. I work as Tech Lead in their acquirer company named Redecard.</p>
    <p>I'm married, and I have four beautiful daughters. My oldest girl became a young woman this year. I served as a missionary here in Brazil, and after my mission I met my wife in an activity for the young singles adults during the carnival.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church since I was born, and I've been in the Sao Paulo Brazil Santo Amaro stake since I was 11 years old. I had a lot of different calling, currently I'm serving as second counselor in the stake presidency.</p>
